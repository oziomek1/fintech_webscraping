The global smartphone market is forecasted to return to growth in 2020 after seeing three straight years of decline driven mainly by 5G ready handsets. The smartphone manufacturers have introduced multiple-lens cameras and large-sized sensors in order to differentiate their offering from the competition. The company will invest in a new manufacturing plant in Nagasaki Prefecture aiming to capitalise on growing demand for high-end cameras in devices which utilise ultra-fast 5G networks. Sony is planning to have the plant online by early FY2021 and the new plant will be the first new semiconductor plant to go into operation in five years for the company. The global image sensor market is dominated by Sony with a market share of about 50% in 2018, followed by Samsung Electronics who commands a 20% market share.\nSony\u2019s largest business segment Game & Network Services\u2019 (G&NS) revenue accounted for about 27% of consolidated revenues in FY03/2019 while the segment\u2019s operating profits stood at around 35% of consolidated operating profits for the year. In 2QFY03/2019, Sony\u2019s G&NS segment\u2019s revenue declined due to decrease in gaming sales while segment\u2019s profits dropped as a result of cost associated with developing the company\u2019s next generation console PS5. The Game & Network Services segment\u2019s operating profit accounted for only 23% of Sony\u2019s profits for the quarter. The Imaging & Sensing Solutions segment (I&SS), which includes image sensors contributed 27% of the consolidated operating profits for the quarter in spite of accounting for only 15% of company revenues during the quarter. Despite G&NS\u2019s earnings declining, Sony managed to clock growth in operating profit for the quarter as a result of the stellar performance of its image sensor business whose revenues and operating profit grew 22.1% YoY and 60% YoY respectively.\nWe believe, Sony\u2019s image sensor business has good potential which could offset weaknesses in other segments such as gaming, consumer electronics, etc. The strengthening image sensor business gives Sony more leverage to argue against Daniel Loeb\u2019s call for the company to spin off its image sensor business and prove that it is in fact one of the crucial pillars of its Growth Strategy."}, {"url": "https://www.smartkarma.com/insights/honda-tob-for-showa-7274-this-one-is-too-cheap", "sector_name": "consumer_discretionary", "author": "Travis Lundy", "author_role": "Pan-Asia Catalysts/Events", "entity": "Showa Corp", "vertical": "Event-Driven", "title": "Honda TOB for Showa (7274) - THIS One Is Too Cheap", "views": 108, "date": " 31 Oct 2019 02:07", "text": "Yesterday morning before the open, the Yomiuri carried headlines suggesting that Honda Motor (7267 JP)'s three large auto parts affiliates - Showa Corp (7274 JP), Keihin Corp (7251 JP), and Nissin Kogyo (7230 JP) - would merge with Hitachi Ltd (6501 JP)'s unlisted Hitachi Automotive business.

Near term weakness in the stock, triggered by the possible sale of pre-IPO-shares, could be an entry opportunity for long term investors.

The stock is currently trading at less than 7X EV/revenue based on our 2021 Revenue estimate of USD 1bn.\nBeyond Meat Inc (BYND US) reported robust Q3 FY19 performance - it turned net positive for the first time, backed by strong sales volume and steep fall in COGS per pound. Volume growth is backed by lower unit selling price (ASP) and a series of successful rollouts across several Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), a segment which it had not hitherto explored actively. It has also tied up adequate supplies of raw material and co-packing facilities for 2020, including a facility in Europe, assuaging earlier concerns on supply chain bottlenecks. With its products under testing by leading QSRs including Mcdonald's Corp (MCD US) and continuing efforts to lower down ASP per pound, we expect growth momentum to continue.\nPotential to disrupt the meat industry - seems closer than earlier.

This follow-up insight mainly discusses the company\u2019s valuation. China Feihe, China\u2019s largest infant milk formula company opened the book building for its Hong Kong IPO on Monday (28th October 2019).\nAt an IPO price of HK$7.5-10 a share, the company is expected to raise gross proceeds of HK$6.7-8.9bn (US$0.96-1.28 a share) with an expected market capitalisation of HK$67-89bn (US$8.6-11.4bn). This will give the company an EV of about HK$56-76bn (adjusted for gross IPO proceeds).\nChina Feihe IPO Details\nNo. of Shares Offered\n                893,000,000\nTotal Shares Outstanding\n             8,933,000,000\nOffer as a % of Total Shares Outstanding\n10.0%\nIPO Price\nHK$7.5-10.0\nGross Proceeds\nHK$6.7-8.9bn\nMarket Capitalisation (HK$bn)\nHK$67-89bn\nEnterprise Value (HK$bn)\nHK$56-76bn\nTrading Date\n13th November 2019\nSource: Company Disclosures (Net debt is adjusted for gross proceeds from IPO)\nBased on our analysis, we believe the company\u2019s IPO target price and the implied valuation are reasonable compared to its average local and international peer multiples. However, comparing the company against its global counterpart, Bellamy\u2019s Australia reveals that the company\u2019s multiples are at a severe discount to Bellamy\u2019s who has a much smaller operation with negative growth in revenues and only a fraction of Feihe\u2019s margins.\nGiven the company\u2019s exposure and strong presence in the growing Chinese IMF market, Feihe\u2019s top-line and bottom-line will see strong growth over the next couple of years, which should warrant a higher valuation for the company. That being said, potential investors should wary of risks arising from governance related concerns and others such as contamination or spoilage of IMF products, shortage of fresh milk, stringent regulations in terms of quality and standards, more mothers opting to breastfeed and the tension between the US and China which could hurt Feihi\u2019s nutritional supplement business in the US, Vitamin World.\nPlease click on the following links to access our previous insights on the company:\nhttps://www.smartkarma.com/insights/china-feihe-ipo-right-formula-for-growth-but-there-could-be-risks\nhttps://www.smartkarma.com/insights/china-feihe-ipo-part-ii-right-formula-for-growth"}, {"url": "https://www.smartkarma.com/insights/beyond-meat-slips-bellow-100-in-the-wake-of-lock-up-expiry-despite-strong-3q2019-results", "sector_name": "consumer_staples", "author": "LightStream Research", "author_role": "Long-Short Equity Analysis on Japan and India", "entity": "Beyond Meat Inc", "vertical": "Equity Bottom-Up", "title": "Beyond Meat Slips Bellow $100 in the Wake of Lock-Up Expiry Despite Strong 3Q2019 Results", "views": 122, "date": " 29 Oct 2019 18:39", "text": "Beyond Meat became one of the hottest IPO\u2019s of 2019 as the stock price appreciated 840% from the IPO price within just 3 months from the IPO.

Beyond Meat\u2019s secondary offering at $160 a share didn\u2019t help the cause as it also prompted a sudden and a sharp decline in the share price. On the other hand, insiders also decided to cash in a portion of their ownership at around $175 a share range during early August 2019. Since then the share price has gradually declined until the end of September 2019.\nThe rate of decline has worsened afterwards as the IPO and other latter stage investors have decided to cash in before the end of the lock-up expiry period which is scheduled to be on 29th October 2019. As a result, in October 2019 the share price fell below $100 for the first time since June 2019.\nSource: Cap IQ"}, {"url": "https://www.smartkarma.com/insights/china-feihe-ipo-valuation-is-good-for-you", "sector_name": "consumer_staples", "author": "Arun George", "author_role": "IPOs, M&A and TMT analyst", "entity": "China Feihe", "vertical": "Equity Capital Markets", "title": "China Feihe IPO: Valuation Is Good for You", "views": 245, "date": " 28 Oct 2019 16:53", "text": "China Feihe (FEIHE HK) is the leading player in the China IMF (infant milk formula) market as measured by retail sales value in 2018, according to Frost & Sullivan.

WOR viewed the \"highly conditional\" Offer as materially undervaluing the company and that it was not in the best interests of shareholders.  On 1 March 2017, Dar Group acquired 13.45% in WOR with a right to increase its overall economic exposure to 19.9% in the near term, which it achieved on the 27 November.  Taking advantage of the \"creep\" exception, Dar Group reached 22.89% on the 31 July 2018.  WOR announced the acquisition of Jacobs Engineering Group (JEC US) in Oct 2018 to be funded via an A$2.9bn non-renounceable entitlement offer and A$985mm of stock issued to Jacobs. Dar continues to creep and WOR has now taken its case to FIRB to contain further share acquisitions.\nWOR is jumping the gun on FIRB. Dar has not made a full-blown takeover offer; yet WOR is pre-empting such a scenario by effectively asking whether FIRB would approve of Dar ultimately taking control in WOR - or at least, having a management role in the direction of the company.\nI would buy here. WOR is not overly cheap relative to domestic peers but is not overly expensive relative to global peers. You have a large active buyer - one that has made an indicative offer previously - in a company whose management does not want to relinquish control or enter into corporate agreements.\nFIRB may well restrict Dar from a full-takeover - the concept of information, such as intellectual property, as opposed to assets, is still something FIRB will go after - but FIRB is unlikely to block Dar buying on market on account of national security concerns. \n(link to my insight: WorleyParsons Gets That Creeping Feeling)\nUnizo Holdings (3258 JP) (Mkt Cap: $1.6bn; Liquidity: $25mn)\nBlackstone has made public its intentions. It has pre-empted the rest of Elliott's questions and may launch a new bid at \u00a55,000/share but it want's UNIZO's \"consent.\" This new bid appears to be the same as the old one, and probably the same as had been re-proposed 7 October and re-rejected 10 October by UNIZO management and board.  UNIZO does not have to give consent, in which case, Blackstone will \"consider all options.\" This could draw out a competing bid from Fortress, which has extended its offer to the 1 November, and can, under Japanese law, extend all the way until the deadline.  This could also draw out a competing bid from someone else.\nTravis Lundy thinks there is a non-negligible likelihood that UNIZO will reject Blackstone. If they do not and Blackstone launches, there is a non-negligible possibility UNIZO will try to throw other sand in the gears and Blackstone's bid might not get to two-thirds. \nHe also thinks there is no way an Acquirer will agree to UNIZO's terms if they include employee control over acquirer exit (price, timing, method), demand an employee stake financed by the assets just purchased, or if UNIZO requires that employees have veto right over directors. Travis would be surprised they have not been told that by their bankers/advisers/regulators.\nFrom \u00a54950 higher, a trade is about someone else coming in to fight and UNIZO capitulating to everyone. I don't see that happening smoothly. Elliott sent a letter to UNIZO warning that it must act with duty of caution and faithfulness to all shareholders, and warns if it does not, Elliott will take any and all measures available to it. Elliott strongly urges the company seriously consider the Blackstone proposal which clearly protects and rewards employees.\n(link to Travis' insight Blackstone To Bid for UNIZO - Still Not A \"Done Deal\")\nAdani Gas Ltd (ADGAS IN) (Mkt Cap: $2.3bn; Liquidity: $1.5mn)\nTotal Sa (FP FP) and Adani Gas made an announcement (Total, Adani Gas) that they had expanded their partnership to create India's premier gas utility/distribution company.  As part of that increased partnership agreement, Total announced a Sale and Purchase Agreement with the intent to acquire 411,331,740 (37.4%) shares of Adani Gas in total at Rs. 149.63/share. Given Total's intent to acquire and exercise control (with the Existing Promoter Group) of Adani Gas pursuant to the SPA and the Shareholder Agreement, and that Total's stake will increase by more than 25% of the Voting Share Capital, this creates an obligation to conduct a Mandatory Open Offer.\nTotal therefore also announced an Open Offer to buy up to 277,146,602 shares (25.2%) of Adani Gas at the same price. To the extent that the public does not sell its shares into the Open Offer, Adani Gas promoters will sell shares to get Total to a 37.4% stake in aggregate - a similar % to the Promoters - after the transactions are completed.  The Offer is not likely to start for a couple of months, but given the entire float is 25.2% and the Open Offer size is 25.2%, there is functionally a put option at Rs. 149.63 for the next couple of months.\nAs Brian Freitas writes, this is not a deal designed to see Total bump the price. It is specifically designed to transfer 37.4% from the Adanis to Total.\nThose \"institutional\" holders will either tender, or will not. Either way, it will not affect you much if you tender what you have. However, IF you are long because you want to own the back end, and they tender, you could find yourself facing the prospect of a very large offering which has to be done to keep the stock listed.  If all of the float tenders, what happens then? Either the new owners of 100% - the Adani Promoters and Total - decide to have the Adanis sell down 25% in an Offer for Sale sometime in the next year, OR, they decide to take it private.\nIn spirit, this deal vaguely reminds Travis of what happened with the Lee family and Cheil Industries several years ago. The stock was listed/spun out, pushed up, merged with something a lot cheaper (i.e. sold expensively) and then the shares fell for a long time, but the promoters got what they wanted out of it. And those who were not promoters did not.\nAs an arb, Travis would look to buy the shares at a discount to terms on any weakness (below about INR 147) and to tender in.  As a long-only investor, if you own shares, you own something illiquid and structurally way more expensive than its peers or potential peers. If you were long, he would sell here unless you wanted to own the option of a squeeze higher for people looking at the back end. There IS a possibility of a squeeze higher because there is a put option here. \nlinks to:\nTravis' insight: TOTAL to Take a Stake in Adani Gas \nBrian Freitas' insight: Adani Gas - Don't Bet on a Total Bump\nErm Power Ltd (EPW AU)  (Mkt Cap: $400mn; Liquidity: $1mn)\nOn the 22 August, ERM entered into a Scheme Implementation Deed (SID) with Shell Energy Australia under which Shell proposed to acquire 100% of ERM at A$2.465/share (including a full-year A$0.045 dividend). ERM directors unanimously recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme.  ERM's major shareholder (~27.39%) has confirmed he also intends to vote in favour of the Scheme. Since the SID, Perpetual has increased its stake to 8.89%, up from 6.63%, with the highest price paid of A$2.43/share - on an ex-dividend basis. 8.89% is not enough to block the Scheme, but it does raise the bar on this deal getting up and will give Shell some pause.\nPerpetual's average in-price prior to the SID was A$1.43/share, and its overall in-price after recent buying is A$1.67. The Scheme consideration, including the full-year dividend was 72% and 48% above both these figures. One would have thought that was a pretty sound investment with a view to exit.\nTurnouts for recent Aussie scheme meetings have been lackluster - 65% voted at the Ruralco Holdings (RHL AU) Scheme and 53% at Kidman Resources (KDR AU)'s.  Turnouts for ERM's AGM have similarly been apathetic at ~55% and 67% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Netting off Perpetual's stake at the 2018 AGM - assuming it voted - would indicate if all shareholders present at that time voted for the Scheme, and Perpetual voted against, you would get to ~87% approval.\nWhat would sway Perpetual, already sitting on a ~50% gain? A 10% bump would cost Shell  Australia~US$40mn. A chunk of change but manageable for a company backed by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA LN), and is still a cheap takeout multiple relative to peers and precedent transactions. I wouldn't rule out a kiss here for Shell to get a lock on the Scheme vote.\n(link to my insight Perpetual Angles For A Bump In ERM Power)\nNetmarble Corporation (251270 KS) (Mkt Cap: $6.4bn; Liquidity: $15mn)\nNumerous Korean media reports mentioned that the Woongjin Group will likely pick Netmarble to be the preferred bidder to acquire a 25.08% stake in Woongjin Coway for \u20a91.83tn. \nAccording to Douglas Kim, at the core of what's wrong behind Netmarble's attempt to acquire Woongjin Coway is that a game business has virtually no synergies with a home appliance business that provides air/water purifiers. If Netmarble succeeds in acquiring Woongjin Coway, this will likely have a major negative impact on the long-term prospects of Netmarble's game business because so much of the company's capital will be allocated to acquiring Woongjin Coway and Netmarble will be less financially secure in continuing to make significant investments in its core game business.\nThis announcement today is likely to put strong negative pressure on Netmarble shares and slightly positive pressure on Woongjin Coway shares in the next few weeks. He suggested being short Netmarble and long Woongjin Coway on this arb trade. Netmarble closed down 3% on the week versus +6% for Coway.\n(link to Douglas' insight: Korea M&A Spotlight: Netmarble to Acquire Woongjin Coway?

As the industry focused on price cuts to clear up the inventory of vehicles to meet the China V Emission Standard, the inventory index dropped to 50.4% in June, the lowest level in recent years. Luxury automobiles achieved a double-digit growth in the first half of the year, yet competition within this segment remains fierce, notably for BMW brands.\nBack in December 2015, China Grand Automotive Services (600297 CH) made a partial Offer for (75%) for Grand Baoxin Auto (1293 HK) at $5.99/share, or a PER (LTM) of 22.7x. CGA was trading at 29.7x. The only other major transaction for premier motor dealerships in China in recent years was Jardine Strategic Hldgs (JS SP) acquiring a 20% stake in Zhongsheng Group (881 HK) for US$731mn at an estimated 30x trailing PER.\nShould CITIC table an Offer, this will likely be in the form of a Scheme. DCH is incorporated in Hong Kong, therefore, there is no headcount test. FY18 earnings were the recent high watermark, with shares trading above $4, up to a high of $4.49. Forecast earnings are not expected to match or exceed those earnings until FY21E. Recent Offers by SOE  - assuming CITIC make an Offer - have been pitched at ~40-50% premium to last close, or a potential Offer Price of $3.77-$4.04. This premium may be tempered by the recent price increase. \n(link to my insight: BMW-Distributor Dah Chong To Be Privatised?)\nSamantha Thavasa Japan (7829 JP)  (Mkt Cap: $80mn; Liquidity: $2mn)\nKonaka Co Ltd (7494 JP)'s purchase of the 31.3% stake in Thavasa was triggered by the retirement of Kazumasa Terada, the founder and CEO of Samantha Thavasa in April. At that time, Kensuke Konaka, the CEO of the suits retailer, had made the deal to acquire half of Terada's 62.6% stake in Samantha Thavasa \u2013 the two CEOs had known each other for 10 years and Terada had sought Konaka's advice on numerous occasions.\nWith Konaka now the leading shareholder alongside Terada, there is an opportunity to rebuild the bag and accessories retailer but whether Konaka is the company that can make this happen is another question. Known as much for its celebrity ties as its products, Thavasa has seen a downturn in its fortunes in recent years, prompting the resignation of the 53-year old founder and former CEO.\n The biggest issue for Thavasa is whether it can adapt to an era when celebrities have much less impact than social influencers via social media. For a company that relied entirely on celebrities for its appeal, this is fundamental. Burnedesrose's success in using social media suggests Thavasa could make the shift.\nThe remaining question is whether there is any benefit for Konaka. While the suits retailer is struggling, as much as its competitors, with the contraction in the suits market and the retirement of their core customers, its Difference chain shows its determination to revive its fortunes and Thavasa could help given its skills in marketing and fashion cycles.\n(link to Michael Causton 's insight: Suits and Handbags: Konaka and Samantha Thavasa Tie the Knot)\nDalian Port (Pda) Co Ltd H (2880 HK)  (Mkt Cap: $2.9bn; Liquidity: $1mn)\nThe Composite Document for China Merchants Group Limited's (CMG) Offer for Dalian Port has now been dispatched. The Closing Date of the Offer is the 28 October. This is a forced Offer via a restructuring. It is not the intention of CMG to delist Dalian Port.\nIt is possible the 25% free float is breached; however, CMG has made it clear it will \"take appropriate steps to ensure that sufficient public float exists in the H Shares following the close of the H Share Offer\". In addition, CMG \"does not intend to exercise any right or power which may be available to it to compulsorily acquire any H Shares outstanding and not acquired under the H Share Offer after the close of the H Share Offer\". Tendering since the Offer was open for acceptances - upon the issuance of the Circular - is estimated at 1.09%. \nDalian Port is trading in line with listed Hong Kong ports on a P/B metric, but is more expensive on trailing PER and EV/EBITDA multiples. You have a hard floor at $1.0127 for the next week or so. There are expectations of further group restructuring as the three ports are integrated. Dalian Ports also reported solid 2019 interim results; therefore, shares may not decline significantly (if at all) once the Offer closes. Regardless, the sentiment remains downbeat as the ongoing trade dispute exacts a less receptive business environment on port operators.\n(link to my insight Dalian Ports' Unconditional MGO)\nRobinson Public Company (ROBINS TB) / Central Retail (192323Z TB) \nUnless you work in a giant fund, chances are you won't get allocations for the super-sized IPO of the decade like CRC. Athaporn Arayasantiparb, CFA's plan is to invest in ROBINS and then swap them for CRC shares during the IPO. This trade is not without its risk. The tender offer may simply fail,  ROBINS stays listed, albeit with much lower liquidity. CRC might go back and improve the swap ratio. The tender goes through, and most of the returns come from the IPO rather than the swap itself. \nNeither the IPO price nor the swap ratio is out yet on this strange deal, and the timeline hasn't been announced. Ideally, they might aim to do this before the end of the year, but this deal has been delayed so many times. This will be one of the biggest IPOs of the decade. They don't need to make way for others. Perhaps the IPO comes through in January (since markets are usually up in Jan), and the next big one, PTTOR, can go through in May.\n(link to Athaporn's insight: Reality Check XXII: How Might the Central-Robinson Trade Pan Out?)\nSTUBS\nChina Everbright (165 HK) / Everbright Securities Co (A) (601788 CH) \nCEL has reversed its one-year underperformance relative to the HSI and major investment Everbright Sec, gaining 21% in the past month on 3x the average volume in the preceding 12-months. I see the discount at 55% compared to a one-year average of ~50%.\nInterim results came out on the 29 August, wherein profit declined to HK$1.28bn from HK$1.9bn, primarily due to higher unrealised gains on financial assets in the 1H18. Operating income for the period was up 18% yoy to HK$1.35bn.\nThe reason for the recent outperformance? There is nothing obvious. A recent Reuters article discussed the potential listing of China Everbright Group next year (in Hong Kong), in a move to restructure its business interests. SOE China Everbright is CEL's largest (& controlling) shareholder with 49%.  A potential IPO of the mothership may help refocus investors on various holdings of the group, such as CEL.\nI think CEL has more to run here as it closes in on its one-year average. CEL guides an internal fair value per share of HK$35 - 35% higher than my book NAV - which mainly factors in the value of the fund management fees.\n(link to my insight StubWorld: China Everbright Bounces Off Lows But Still Cheap)\nEVENTS \nToshiba Corp (6502 JP) (Mkt Cap: $15.8bn; Liquidity: $76mn)\nToshiba announced a Shareholder Returns policy in May 2018 to buy back \u00a5700bn of shares. That buyback is ending (Nov 8th). There is unlikely enough capital to be able to do another buyback near-term, no matter what hedge funds putting out big decks say. The ongoing \"understanding\" by investors about the cash position created by the sale of TMC last summer is wrong. There was cash. Read Mio Kato, CFA's piece from last month called Toshiba: Approaching the End of the Buyback and the End of Net Cash, especially the part about the net cash position and the comparison to peers. \nAt the October 1 meeting, external directors seem to have pointed to a very strong attention to the idea of capital management and returns, and getting rid of businesses which did not meet the hurdles. This kind of talk from external directors is a really, VERY helpful development for shareholders. The talk about using leverage to improve capital returns will likely be taken well.\nTravis is still long Toshiba Tec (6588 JP) and Toshiba Plant Systems & Services (1983 JP) on expectation of bringing Toshiba Plant in-house through a merger, and getting better EV out of Toshiba Tec - whether that means bringing it in, or selling it. Because both companies have both net cash and good equity, a scrip merger paying a premium would probably work. Toshiba would get more cash, and if merged then split out, would give Toshiba more capital to distribute. \nThe lack of buyback could end up being significant. As of Q2 earnings on November 13th, Toshiba will have bought about 24% of the ADV every day for almost a year. Losing that cushion means little leeway.  If you are long Toshiba because of better capital allocation, Travis recommends getting out into strength. If you are long Toshiba because you expect growth, he would pay close attention to what the business heads say on the 14th about where they realistically think they can get margins to go.\n(link to Travis' insight Toshiba Buyback Ending: The Next Catalyst Is Restructuring)\nSamsung Electronics (005930 KS) (Mkt Cap: $280bn; Liquidity: $380mn)\nThe KRX has a 30% cap rule such that no single stock is allowed to surpass 30% of the total index market cap in KOSPI 200. Samsung just touched 30%. KOSPI 200 rebalances twice a year: June and December. The constituent change takes place only in June. However, some changes such as index market cap weight can take place in the December rebalancing as well. Therefore the 30% cap is to be imposed at the upcoming rebalancing this December if the weight of Samsung remains above 30%. \n(link to Sanghyun Park's insight Samsung Elec 30% Cap in KOSPI 200? What to Be Expected?)\nThe Japan Market (lots of liquidity)\nThe TOPIX 2019 Free Float Weight Rebalance announcement was made on the 7th of October and the moves in the basket so far are limited. It is still a near-$20bn trade for month-end so investors should be aware of what is moving. There may be portfolio rebalance opportunities for your stocks trading on a LOC basis on the event day.\nThe big-caps big-dollars inclusion trade has done well. The high ADV trade has done better. Travis expects the high ADV trade to continue to do well through the end of October, but is a low-liquidity low-dollar-value trade. \nThere is significant (relative) opportunity to gain liquidity to buy or sell at month-end (30 October) if you want to buy or sell the illiquid names.\nTravis - as per his previous two pieces suggested - is still slightly bullish Z Holdings (4689 JP) for this event.\nM&A - EUROPE\nNordex SE (NDX1 GR) (Mkt Cap: $1.4bn; Liquidity: $11mn)\nOn October 8th, 2019, Acciona SA (ANA SM) communicated to the market that it will subscribe to 9.7mn new shares in Nordex at EUR10.21/share or EUR99mn in total. This would lift its holdings to 38.6mn shares, or 36.27%, up from 29.9%, triggering an unconditional Offer for all remaining shares at the three-month VWAP or EUR10.32/share. \nThe offer represents a 1.7% premium to last close and 3% premium to the three months average closing price. The average closing share price of the five days period since the bid announcement has been EUR 11.04 per share. The market reaction seems to anticipate a sweetened offer by Acciona to Nordex shareholders.\nPlacing Nordex on the average 2020E EV/EBITDA in line with European industry peers backs out a possible fair value of EUR14.26/share, or ~28% upside at the time of Jesus Rodriguez Aguilar's insight. Nordex shares traded at that level last Spring. Jesus' recommendation is to be long Nordex.\n(link to Jesus' insight: Nordex (NDX1 GR): Winds of Change)\nSophos (SOPH LN) (Mkt Cap: (Mkt Cap: $3.6bn; Liquidity: $22mn)\nIn his first published insight on Smartkarma, Quiddity team-member  Janaghan Jeyakumar, CFA (who will write on events, especially M&A) writes that on the 14th October US PE firm Thoma Bravo, which specialises in \"buy-and-build\" (buy a company, than make it a lot bigger through add-on acquisitions) investing over the last 40yrs, announced an agreed deal to buy out cyber-security firm Sophos to go with the $9.5bn of other cyber-security firms they have purchased in the last three-plus years.\nThe deal is friendly and Thoma Bravo has secured irrevocable commitments from the two co-founders and other insiders and directors, making up 27.2% of the shares out.\nThe deal launched at premia of 37%, 40%, and 55% to the undisturbed price, 3-month VWAP, and 1-year VWAP respectively, is at US$7.40/share less any potential special dividend, and now offers a 1.5% spread at current price, for a deal expected to close late in Q1 2020.\nJanaghan sees no serious anti-trust threats to the deal, and tech and support synergies with its existing portfolio may justify the higher-than-average multiple paid.\nlink to Janaghan's insight: Thoma Bravo Scoops Up Sophos\nBriefly ...\nPatryk Basiewicz dives into Cellnex Telecom Sau (CLNX SM)'s EUR2.2bn/\u00a32bn acquisition of Arqiva's c.7400 tower sites and Cellnex's accompanying rights issue with a dilution of c. 22.5% and proceeds of EUR2.5bn; and concludes Celnex is not expensive relative to peers.

WOR viewed the \"highly conditional\" Offer as materially undervaluing the company and that it was not in the best interests of shareholders. \nOn the 1 March, Dar Group acquired 13.45% in WOR with a right to increase its overall economic exposure to 19.9% in the near term, which it achieved on the 27 November. \nHerein lies the rub - under s611, item 9, of Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act 2001, investors holding 19.9% can acquire up to 3% every six months - known as the \"creep\" exception.\nDar Group reached 22.89% on the 31 July 2018. \nWOR subsequently announced on the 22 October 2018 the acquisition of the energy, chemicals, and resource division of Jacobs Engineering Group (JEC US), for a cash and debt-free total enterprise value of US$3.3bn (A$4.6bn). Simultaneously, WOR announced the acquisition would be funded via an A$2.9bn non-renounceable entitlement offer and A$985mm of stock issued to Jacobs at the theoretical ex-rights price or A$16.92, of the entitlement offer (1 share for every 1.47 held), which will itself be done at A$15.56. It also involved WOR taking on new debt.\nAs Travis Lundy discussed in his insight (WorleyParsons' Giant Makeover) at the time, the question for investors at the time was whether this investment was late economic cycle desperation for growth, an anti-takeover measure (against Dar Group), or was it picking up a decent business with rising backlog at the low-margin point of its cycle.\nRegardless, Dar Group has continued to accumulate. WOR has now taken its case to FIRB to contain further share acquisitions.\nMore detail below.\nPlease see the Quiddity Australia M&A Guide 2019 for more details on the ins and outs (and foibles) of Australian rules, regulations, and practices in M&A.

He visited a local supermarket and shared his thoughts on Feihe's product and the local sentiment. Ming Lu will continue to cover China tech companies and work closely with us \nFeihe IPO: Actively Promoted in Supermarkets, Some Concerns on Industrial History \nComplementing Ming Lu's research, Ke Yan, CFA, FRM looked at the company from a quantitative perspective, comparing it with peers, and gave his thoughts on valuation. \nChina Feihe (\u4e2d\u56fd\u98de\u9e64) IPO: Peer Comparison and Thoughts on Valuation \nOverall, Hong Kong IPOs are going full steam ahead in Q4. Languang Justbon Services (2606 HK) closed 15% above its IPO price on debut (way better than our expectation), riding on positive sentiment of recently listed smaller IPOs and the general outperformance of the HK-listed property management companies of late.\nWe are also hearing that JS Global Lifestyle (JSG HK) and ESR Cayman (ESR HK) will launch their bookbuilds on Monday. JSG is looking to raise about US$400 - 500m while ESR is likely launching a US$1.3bn deal size with about the same deal size as before (in June). Other than that, CMGE Tech (CMGE HK) launched its US$166m IPO bookbuild this week with some interesting cornerstone investors and we heard that books were already covered.

The company sold about 42.5% stake to a KKR-led consortium.

Latitude Financial Services (1272471D AU) was pulled even after cutting its IPO price by 11% ahead of its bookbuild. Valuation was still expensive compared to peers like FlexiGroup. So far, we have yet to hear anything ahead of PropertyGuru (PGU AH) bookbuild but Onsite Rental (ONSITE AU) is already prepping up for its IPO.\nPropertyGuru IPO - Agents Q&A Shows Its Stranglehold in S'pore; Throws up Some Interesting Nuggets \nOnsite Rental IPO - Still on the Acquisition Led Growth Path, Despite the Recapitalisation \nIn India, we are hearing that SAMHI Hotels is pre-marketing its US$350m IPO and looking to launch Q1 2020 and Equitas Holdings Ltd/India (EQUITAS IN) appointed JM Financial, IIFL and Edelweiss Financial, for the Equitas Small Finance Bank\u2019s IPO.\nAccuracy Rate:\nOur overall accuracy rate is 72.7% for IPOs and 64.9% for Placements \n(Performance measurement criteria is explained at the end of the note)\nNew IPO filings this week\n\nInnocare Pharma (Hong Kong, US$200m)\nBelow is a snippet of our IPO tool showing upcoming events for the next week.

On 27 September - only 4 days before the end of the Offer, ams purchased 100 shares and booked it on the London exchange, then used that as an excuse to lift the price to be paid to all shareholders who accepted and did so without changing the Offer Prospectus, which would have required a two-week extension. The goal, at the time, was likely to oblige shareholders to choose hard cash on the barrelhead then - \u20ac41/share - vs the possibility that Private Equity firms Bain and Advent would come up with an Offer which was \"meaningful improvement\" over the \u20ac38.50/share which ams had been offering to that point. \nams got to 51.6%. And the world awaited what might come next.\nams would have the possibility of asking BaFin for an exception (to the rule requiring them to wait) to be able to launch another Offer in the near future (the \"exception\" is possible because it would legally be a different company making the new bid), and... \nBain and Advent might come out with an Offer even higher, which might be supported by Osram management. \nA few days later ams was adamant it still wanted to get a deal done. Bain and Advent were doing due diligence. \nFinally, on 18 October, Bain and Advent let Osram know that they were not going to proceed with an Offer at the time, and ams moved forward. A few days later, Osram supervisory board member and IG Metall trade union representative Klaus Abel said, \u201cThe reasons for our clear opposition to a takeover by AMS remain unchanged... The already elevated financial risks have even been exacerbated by the new approach.\u201d Osram\u2019s trade union still rejects ams' plans, fearing the deal may lead to at least a partial breakup of the company (ams has made no bones about wanting to sell Osram's digital business) and a loss of jobs (ams CEO Everke has said no jobs would be lost in Germany, but has suggested there would be some overlap in Malaysia, particularly at the opto-semiconductors unit, which built an LED chip production site in Kulim, Malaysia, in 2016).\nThis week ams CEO Alexander Everke said on an investor call that ams was seeking a cooperation agreement with Osram before launching a new Offer, hoping to garner a better level of support from the supervisory board, and might lead to CEO Olaf Berlien agreeing to tender his shares, which he did not do the first time, which might lead some investors on the fence to tender theirs.\nThe hints being given out to the media the last several days suggest the new Offer could be launched by end-October dependent on BaFin approval. \nThe market clearly embraced the concept of the new Offer, jumping from the low \u20ac38s a share to \u20ac40 on the news, where it has settled as of noon on Friday.

There should be significant opportunities to trade a large liquid position in a range trade. If the price settles down in a very tight range, there is considerable benefit in being aware of market microstructure trading possibilities.\nCCASS movements indicate Maanshan Iron & Steel H (323 HK)'s Offer will turn unconditional on the 29 October.\nThe marginal upside vs the marginal downside in the ZOZO Inc (3092 JP) partial offer situation near-term may be skewed to the downside. The consensus target price has flatlined since mid-July this year, and this leaves analysts open to changing their minds.

The Partial Offer Price is S$7.35/share, which is a 26% premium to undisturbed and a 21% premium to 3-month VWAP. If everyone in the minority tenders, it will result in 38.91% of your shares being purchased. Pre-conditions are regulatory approvals, 50+% of non-affiliated shareholders voting for the Offer, and Temasek reaching 51.0% as a result of the Offer.\nKeppel is not a very high volatility stock. This is at a 26% premium, but it is well under the 2-year high. There will be shareholders who are disappointed. They do not have to tender. It is remotely possible that the deal does not get done because it is not quite generous enough. It is long-dated enough that macroeconomic variables could play a role either up or down. \nBecause this is a very long-dated pre-conditional offer situation, Travis Lundy would expect the shares to trade somewhat cheap early on, then trade more expensively as the Offer is officially announced.  Borrow will become available. Traders must decide how much is likely to come.\nThis is a big deal, on a relatively liquid stock, which will garner much attention, locally and internationally.  It will entice very large arbitrageurs to play in large size. In order to do the arb, they will need to own the shares. Period.\nTravis expects this - like many partial tenders - will present opportunities to get in, get out, get in again, and get out. It is a range trade. The borrow will come later. It will look like taking risk for not much gain, but this is an arb.\n(link to Travis' insight: BIG Temasek Partial Offer for Keppel). Other insights on Keppel this week from Mark Artherton and Arun George.\nMaanshan Iron & Steel H (323 HK)   (Mkt Cap: $2.9bn; Liquidity: $9mn)\nIt looks like I'll have to eat my words. Previously I wrote I was not convinced there were sufficient shares in arb hands for the MGO minimum threshold for unconditionality to be met. Recent CCASS movements indicate this Offer will now turn unconditional.\nThis past Friday, 3.51% (60.8mn) had moved outside of CCASS with an additional 12.59% (218.2mn shares) parked in HKSCC, for 16.10% total tendered. The MGO is conditional on 343.87mn H shares tendering or ~20% of total H shares outstanding and 4.46% of total A&H shares, which together would give China Baowu (the Offeror) 50% of Maanshan.\nThis tendering probably includes PSquared 7.41% stake it held as at 16 October. The First Closing Date is the 29 October. This Offer will automatically be extended for 14 days if unconditional on the 29th.\nFor a quick turnaround, I recommended buying at HK$2.94, where it closed on Friday, versus the Offer Price of $2.97. There is insufficient time to buy and tender by the First Closing Date, but that is largely irrelevant, given the expectation of the Offer being extended.\nUPDATE: The latest CCASS movements confirm the Offer WILL turn unconditional on the 29th. I now see 21.72 tendered.\n(link to my insight: Maanshan's Offer Likely To Turn Unconditional)\nZOZO Inc (3092 JP) (Mkt Cap: $7.1bn; Liquidity: $161mn)\nOn 11 September 2019, Z Holdings (4689 JP) announced it would buy a stake in ZOZO of a minimum of 101.97mm shares (33.4%) up to 152.95mm shares (50.1%) for \u00a52620/share. This is a big deal at \u00a5400bn at the top end.  Founder and chairman Maezawa agreed to subscribe to the Tender Offer for the bulk of his shares - 92.77mm shares, which means it needs little to get over the hurdle. TOPIX is up about 3.4% since the announcement (dividend included, through 18 Oct), and a range of peers in the apparel retailing business have seen their shares up and down in the interim. ZOZO reports on 31 October - two weeks before the end of the Tender Offer on 13 Nov.\nZOZO shares have risen recently as the market has been healthy-ish and borrow has become available for arbitrageurs to tighten the spread. Travis thinks gradually these arbitrageurs have lifted their pro-ration expectations as well, which means more delta required per borrowed share. Assuming the back end is being priced at the TOPIX-performance-adjusted undisturbed price, the market is pricing a pro-ration slightly above 75%. This seems aggressive so he believes the price probably has \u00a535-40 of \"borrow is available so I gotta buy the stock\" impact in it.\nTravis thinks the pro-ration could easily get to 75% - although he is in the 66-71% Camp - if the front-end price is at the current level.  Given that if the stock rises and long-only foreign active portfolio investors decide not to tender, the pro-ration goes up, this would allow arbitrageurs to buy, but borrow enough to tender and get short the Offer Price.  Once the tender offer is over, it is not clear where the long-only \"new demand\" for the shares is.  Historically, over the past ten years, the stock price movement on Q2 earnings is negative at -2.0%. \nThe vast majority of the variability in pro-ration actuals vs estimates is in the level of participation by foreign active investors. Active foreign holdings are 10x that of active domestic holdings. What matters is the foreign active investor reaction to Q2 earnings.  Given how close the market price is to the target price, Travis expects the downside has more impact than upside. Lots of foreign investors bailed earlier this year, and lots of others replaced them. Those investors who bought are all in the money. Furthermore, whatever upside there is from \"business synergies\" or investment directed or encouraged by new ownership at Z Holdings will likely not be announced or forthcoming at the earnings presentation. \n(link to Travis' insight: ZOZO: From Here to Tender Close)\nUnited Engineers (UEM SP)   (Mkt Cap: $1.2bn; Liquidity: $1mn)\nBack in July 2017, Yanlord Perennial Investment (Singapore) Pte. Ltd (YPI), an  SPV comprising Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited (PREH SP) (45%), Yanlord Land Group Ltd (YLLG SP) (49%) and Heng Yue (6%), announced the purchase of Oversea Chinese Banking Corp. Limited (OCBC SP) / Great Eastern Holdings Ltd (GE SP)'s 33.4% stake in UEM, triggering a mandatory Offer for the company at $2.60. The offer was conditional on the Offerors getting to 50% of the voting rights of UEM. The Offer lapsed largely as a result of aggressive buying (above terms) by Oxley Holdings (OHL SP).\nYanlord has now announced it is has entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire all of PREH and HY's interest in YPI - or 51% in total - the completion of which triggers a Mandatory Conditional Offer for UEM. The price under the Offer will be $2.60 - the same price as the 2017 Offer - versus the last close of $2.66. YPI holds 35.27% and the Offer is conditional on 50% acceptance. \nThis is a takeunder. Both Perennial and Heng Yue have opted to exit their positions, at the same price they paid to enter into UEM back in 2017, suggesting $2.60 is/was a full Offer with minimal upside. \nOne takeaway from this announcement is that the next proposal may be further off than people may have thought. Initially, there didn't really appear to be a great put option to this deal; however in early trade last Friday, there were 94mn shares on the bid (presumably Yanlord), which if filled (Oxley?) would fulfil the acceptance condition.\n(link to my insight: United Engineers: Yanlord Takes a Bigger Slice, But Nothing Changes)\nInfosys Ltd (INFO IN)   (Mkt Cap: $38bn; Liquidity: $117mn)\nOn the 21st of October, Infosys announced one board member had received two anonymous whistleblower reports from a group of employees calling themselves \"Ethical Employees\" on 30 September - one titled \u201cDisturbing unethical practices\u201d and one titled \u201cWhistleblower Complaint\u201d according to local press reports. In what may be a coincidence, but seems relevant now, the previous week the Times of India reported that Deputy CFO and EVP Jayesh Sanghrajka quit the company after 14 years. \nThis development comes almost three years after a whistleblower report in February 2017 alleging wrongdoing by Infosys and some of its officials in the US$200mm acquisition of Israeli automated tech firm Panaya in 2015. Last time it took a little over four months from the Whistleblower Reports becoming public and the public announcement of clearance.\nThis time Infosys has the problem that the allegations appear to deal with the accounting treatment of the most recent quarter, for which an Interim Report was filed 11 October.  Scandals about 2-year old minor acquisitions are one thing. Scandals about improper accounting to hide material weakness are another. And if there is a \"tone at the top\" problem with both the CEO and the CFO, that will affect others. \nHistorically, local traders \"known\" that when Infosys falls sharply, once it gets past 10% in 2-3 days, you want to buy the dip because it rebounds somewhat.  Travis wouldn't buy this dip yet. The company will not be updating investors until the investigation is complete. The 2017 investigation took 4+ months. This may not take as long, but he sees no need to rush in yet. There is not much clarity, and if there are indeed real numbers behind this, it would be bad. \n(link to Travis' insight: INFOSYS Whistleblower Report - Too Early To Dip One's Toes In The Water)\nOther insights on Infosys this week are from Mark Artherton, CFA with Infosys - A Buyers Perspective Post Whistle Blowing, from LightStream Research with Infosys - The Grim Numbers on H-1B Rejection Rates, Employee Costs and Unbilled Revenues and from Pranav Bhavsar with Infosys Whistleblower Report | A Channel Check Narrative. \nDah Chong Hong (1828 HK)  (Mkt Cap: $864mn; Liquidity: $2mn)\nDCH was suspended on the morning of the 15 October \"pending the issue of an announcement of inside information relating to a possible privatization proposal\". Shares in the PRC BMW-distributor had mysteriously gained 16% in the past month on higher-than-average daily volume. A firm Offer, by way of a Scheme, has now been announced, at $3.70/share (final offer price). \nPRC dealerships are facing long-term challenges including a market slowdown, evolving customer preferences, increasingly sophisticated competition, and potentially disruptive technologies. Luxury automobiles did achieve a double-digit growth in the first half of the year, yet competition within this segment remains fierce, notably for BMW brands.\nDCH's net profit was down 31.6% in the first six months of 2019 compared to an average decline of 23.6% for its peer group. Only Zhongsheng Group (881 HK) recorded a profit increase (8.7%) during the same period via strong growth in Lexus and Toyota sales.  FY17 earnings were the recent high watermark for DCH, with shares trading above $4 in the 1H18, up to a high of $4.49. Forecast earnings are not expected to match or exceed those earnings until FY21E. \nThis is a straightforward Scheme. Recent operating conditions have not been kind to PRC dealership.  I expect the deal to get up and recommended taking the odds at $3.45 shortly after the announcement. DCH closed the week at $3.58 and a gross/annualised spread of 3.4%/13.4%. \n(link to my insight: The Price Is Right For Dah Chong)\nToshiba Corp (6502 JP)   (Mkt Cap: $16bn; Liquidity: $76mn)\nIn Travis' last insight, Toshiba Buyback Ending: The Next Catalyst Is Restructuring he pointed out that about a quarter (23.6% to be exact) of all on-market volume in the past 11 months or so was Toshiba buying back shares, and in two short weeks that will be done with.  Restructuring can be executed a couple of different ways. It can be capital-based, employee-count, or can be M&A/divestment-related. \nFilings released by Toshiba this week suggest what might be coming.  They are clearing out cross-holdings. They are talking about M&A. They are talking a lot about their listed subs.  They are thinking of going levered.\nThe obvious play here is to be long (or still be long) Toshiba Tec (6588 JP) and possibly Toshiba Plant Systems & Services (1983 JP). Both are trading cheaply vs the parent. Toshiba Plant is part and parcel of the way that Toshiba sees itself going forward. Toshiba Tec is a bit different. It could be split out, or it could be better run inside Toshiba. Travis believes it is eminently sellable at a much higher multiple than the one at which it is currently trading. Selling it would provide a lot of capital to Toshiba. If he had to buy one or the other, it would be Toshiba Tec. \nThe trade?  Be long Toshiba Tec. Be long Toshiba Plant. Be longer Toshiba Tec than Plant. If Toshiba does not announce a specific deal, or a specific pathway to a deal when they disclose earnings on November 13th, buy any resulting big dip on Toshiba Tec.\n(link to Travis' insight: Toshiba Restructuring Coming - Toshiba Tec Is STILL the Right Horse)\nDalian Port (Pda) Co Ltd H (2880 HK)   (Mkt Cap: $2.9bn; Liquidity: $1mn)\nThe Composite Document for China Merchants Group Limited's (CMG) Offer for Dalian Port was dispatched on the 5th October.  The Offer closes on the 28 October. By my reckoning, the 25% free float has now been breached. This is not cause for concern, nor even if the float dips below 15%. But the mechanics of what can transpire are worth noting. \nCMG intends to maintain Dalian Port's listing and will take appropriate steps to ensure that sufficient public float exists. Below 25% and above 15%, shares will continue to trade. But what happens if the float dips below 15% and shares are suspended? \nPresumably, CMG will be able to place out shares to restore the float. But the introduction of the new delisting rule last August means suspended companies have a finite window in which to restore the float. \nUPDATE: The latest CCASS movements indicate the float is now at 19.7%. This may get suspended at the close of trading tomorrow.\n(link to my insight: Dalian Port And \"Truth In Statements\")\nCsg Ltd (CSV AU) (Mkt Cap: $92mn; Liquidity: $1mn)\nFuji Xerox has entered into Scheme of Arrangement with CSG and an Offer price of A$0.31/share, a 31.9% premium to last close. CSG was up 34% YTD ahead of the Offer. CSG's Board recommends CSG shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme in the absence of a superior Offer. Major shareholder Caledonia, with 29.1%, has given an irrevocable to vote in favour of the Scheme. The proposed Scheme is expected to be completed by mid-February 2020.\nApart from obtaining CSG shareholder approval, the Scheme is subject to approvals from the respective regulatory authorities in New Zealand and Australia, neither of which should raise deal-risk concerns, as the market for printing-related goods and services is highly competitive with a major national and multinational competitors in the mix.\nBoth Wentworth (8.5% shareholder) and Forager (5.4%) became substantial shareholders in February 2018, after CSG's shares rolled over after revising downward FY18 guidance. I estimate Forager's average in-price is likely north of A$0.33/share. Wentworth's average price is less clear, but would appear to be above the Scheme consideration.\nCSG has overhauled its sales and marketing, as well as its IT systems. The benefits from this strategy have been minimal to date, but may yield double-digit percentage EBITDA growth in FY20, if executed smoothly. Wentworth/Forager may dig their heels in on this possibility. This is not a big deal for Fuji, and it may need to bump to appease that 14% on the register.\n(link to my insight: Fuji Xerox Finds A Solution In CSG)\nSTUBS\nJardine Matheson Hldgs (JM SP) / Jardine Strategic Hldgs (JS SP) \nJM buybacks are relatively rare beasts. When JM resumed after an eight-year hiatus, it's worth a second look. JM has now bought >US$100mn since 19 September 2019. But don't expect JM to announce the size of the buyback -  after JM (and the rest of the Jardines group of companies) controversially transferred from a premium listing to a standard listing on London's Main Market in 2014, it is under no obligation to make such an announcement, nor seek shareholder approval for  buybacks.\nA scrip offer for Mandarin Oriental Intl (MAND SP)? This is doing the rounds again. MAND owning an office block in its hotel property portfolio is not ideal. It is no longer a clean hotel play. But it's not clear minority shareholders would be keen to swap their holdings into JS shares. And JS shares appear inexpensive at 48% discount to NAV and one wonders if this is a viable option to issue discounted shares to privatise an 82%-held consolidated company.\nCollapsing the circular structure? I see no urgency. The family can continue to chip away at minority ownership in order to capture the discount for insiders and lower the ultimate restructuring cost. JM received US$2.2bn from its sale of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group P (JLT LN) last year, providing ample room for further repurchases of JM.\nJM appears an outright long. A long JM short JS is also available, however, the simple ratio is towards the higher end (1.85x vs. 1.71x long-term), and JS is trading cheap.\n(link to my insight StubWorld: What To Make Of Jardine Matheson's Buybacks?)\nM&A - UK & EUROPE\nJust Eat PLC (JE/ LN) (Mkt Cap: $6.6bn; Liquidity: $31mn)\nProsus (PRX NA) has made an offer for Just Eat at 710p per share or ~20% premium to last close and in line with the price implied by the Takeaway.com bid. Prosus' bid is hostile. Currently, the spread is trading 6.7% though the terms, implying a further bump from Prosus or Takeaway.com NV (TKWY NA), or a counterbid from a third party. Note that once Just Eat is taken over then entry into the UK (and other Just Eat\u2019s markets) will be very difficult in the future. So there is a good reason to think that other players are looking at a further bid.\nIn July 2019, the CMA issued an enforcement order that would halt the progress of Amazon\u2019s attempt to buy 20% in Deliveroo. CMA\u2019s move seems to imply that any transaction involving a player that is already present in the UK, even in an adjacent market, will face a very high bar for CMA approval. However, CMA\u2019s exact motivation is unclear.\nPatryk Basiewicz cannot see any credible new bidders. The most likely ones are Uber and Facebook, but they are both long-shots. Uber due to antitrust concerns and Facebook due to seeming deflation of strategic interest in food delivery. Softbank is also a long-shot, as Just Eat does not quite fit Softbank's history of investments.  in the sector Current media speculations that Softbank is pursuing Spain's Glovo is credible, as Glovo fits Softbank's strategy quite well. \nLack of a credible buyer does not mean that Just Eat should not be trading through terms, as a higher bid from Prosus and/or Takeaway.com is likely. \n(link to my Patryk's insight: Just Eat (JE/ LN): Who Else Can Enter the Bidding War?)\nSophos (SOPH LN) (Mkt Cap: $3.6bn; Liquidity: $25mn)\nOn October 14th, US PE firm Thoma Bravo made an Offer to acquire UK-based cybersecurity company Sophos via a Scheme of Arrangement in an all-cash deal that valued the company at a market cap of US$3.8Bn.  The offer price is fixed at US$7.40 (GBP5.83/share) or a premia of 37% to the undisturbed price. The deal is conditional on the receipt of antitrust approvals and Sophos shareholder approval and is expected to close in 1Q 2020.  \nThis is a friendly deal at a significant premium. The board intends to unanimously recommend the Offer and the acquirer has procured irrevocable commitments from the directors and shareholders who collectively hold 27.2% of Sophos. This includes top shareholder Pentagon Lock (backed by Apax Partners) and founders Peter Lammer and Jan Hruska. \nGiven that the global cybersecurity market is highly fragmented, Janaghan Jeyakumar does not expect antitrust approvals to be a challenge in this deal.\nAt a 1.5% spread, at the time of Janaghan's insight, for about 5-6 months of wait, this offers a slightly higher annualized spread than most recent friendly deals in the UK, cross-border or otherwise.\n(link to Janaghan's insight: Thoma Bravo Scoops Up Sophos)\nOSRAM Licht AG (OSR GR) (Mkt Cap: \u20ac3.9bn; Liquidity: \u20ac30mn)\nEarlier this summer, Bain & Carlyle joined together to launch a recommended takeover of OSRAM Licht AG (OSR GR) at \u20ac35/share. ams AG (AMS SW), desperate to diversify its business from an overconcentration on Apple, decided late in the summer to launch a bid at \u20ac38.50, which was supported by the two boards of Osram but not by the CEO or the Worker Council. Bain wanted Carlyle to overbid, but Carlyle would not. Bain found another partner in Advent and they started doing due diligence promising a deal at a \"meaningful premium\", to which ams responded by raising its bid in the last four days of its Offer to \u20ac41/share. Despite reduced minimum threshold for success, ams did not receive enough shares. But they bought 19.99% on their own, which would frustrate future acquirers.\nIn the last week, Bain and Advent have decided to pass for now, and ams has announced it will launch another deal at  \u20ac41/share but with a still-lower threshold for success. This time 55%. ams seeks an \"Agreement\" with Osram but hasn't said is a sine qua non for proceeding.\nDiscussions between ams and Osram are \"constructive\" and Osram in a press release this week uttered the magic word \"Zukunftskonzept\" which would be key to getting a platform onto which all parties could sign.\nBaFin still has to give its OK, but that is expected shortly. A deal could be launched by end of month or shortly afterwards.\nGiven ams owns 35%, to get to 55% requires only getting 35% of the remaining 80%. Given how much ams might have to pay to get its Profit & Loss Pooling Agreement, if it were willing to lower the threshold it probably should have raised the price slightly given the historical volumes at price of the last five years.\n(link to Travis' insight: New ams Deal for Osram in Store - It's Doable)\nM&A - CANADA\nAltaGas Canada Inc (ACI CN) (Mkt Cap: $4bn; Liquidity: $11mn)\nJust a year from its IPO, Calgary-based natural gas distribution company AltaGas Canada received an all-cash bid from a consortium consisting of Public Sector Pension Investment Board and Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund Board to acquire all its shares via a Plan of Arrangement at an offer price of CAD 33.50/share, valuing the company at a market cap of CAD 1bn. In addition to requiring target shareholder approval (2/3), the transaction is also conditional on the receipt of regulatory approvals from the Canada Competition Bureau, Alberta Utilities Commission, and British Columbia Utilities Commission. \nThe Offer price is an all-time high and more than double the IPO price. In addition, it also translates to healthy premia of 31.4%, 31.6%, and 39.4% to undisturbed price, 3-mth VWAP and 6-mth VWAP respectively. \nFurthermore, the offer price translates to EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, and PER multiples of 5.2x, 16.7x, and 22.7x respectively which are above the estimated median values of 4.5x, 12.6x, and 15.0x for a group of peers. \nThe low complexity of the deal also suggests that this transaction is unlikely to face any significant antitrust concerns and based on precedents, regulatory approvals are likely to be granted in time for the deal to close before the end of 1H 2020. Including the C$0.26/share dividend this November, buying now gives you a 5.1% annualized spread.\n(link to Janaghan's insight: AltaGas Canada Privatization Offer)\nEVENTS\nIndian Index Review\nMSCI will announce the results of the November 2019 Semi-Annual Index Review on 7 November. The constituent changes will be effective from 27 November and the rebalancing trades will need to be done at the close on 26 November.

In fact, since 2017 sales of codes have almost doubled ever year and are expected to double again in FY2020. However, with 10M codes projected to be sold in FY2020 the company is far away from breakeven which is now forecasted to be at 60M codes sold. The company currently claims to receive between 0.10-0.11 USD/code. Its sole user remains Walmart (WMT US). \nAs I have written in the past DiSa remains a great story stock. If the company delivers on its promise it has the potential to be a 10x bagger in the coming 24-36 months and if it fails it is likely a zero.

In particular, Denso and Aisin Seiki would still be larger than even the combined entity resulting from the merger of all four auto parts units.\nSecondly, since Hitachi will reportedly take a 70% stake in the new entity it is important to consider what this move may portend for Hitachi Construction Machinery and Hitachi Metals. Hitachi Chemicals is already reportedly attracting offers and we do not believe this move impacts Hitachi High Technologies situation overly much.\nLastly, this move could be quite significant for Honda and it is pertinent to consider whether Honda will move away from a keiretsu structure with key group company Keihin (which manufactures all important ECUs for Honda) coming under the wing of Hitachi.\nWe discuss the details below."}, {"url": "https://www.smartkarma.com/insights/sk-hynix-bullish-tactics-above-78k-to-work-into-macro-sell-zone", "sector_name": "information_technology", "author": "Thomas Schroeder", "author_role": "Chart based progressive global trading strategies", "entity": "SK Hynix", "vertical": "Technical Analysis", "title": "SK Hynix Bullish Tactics Above 78k to Work into Macro Sell Zone", "views": 94, "date": " 30 Oct 2019 09:07", "text": "SK Hynix (000660 KS) is losing upside momentum as distribution takes shape in choppy overlapping trade.\nThe relative chart denotes a rising wedge struggle that shows similar characteristics to previous relative topping formations versus the Kospi (and versus SEC).\nTactical cycle is constructive as long as 78k support holds and the current micro bull wedge provides energy to clear 86k and edge into our macro sell zone.\nMACD bear divergence that matured in 2018 led to a change in trend and we expect a similar shift to occur  near the topside resistance barrier.

While the business is volatile and dependent on the spreads between naphtha and its products, CAP has advantages in terms of its strategic location and customer relationships, which allow it to command a slight premium over the regional benchmark. The large capex programme to increase capacity and downstream expansion is conservatively funded by both debt and equity (from rights offerings, which have been supported by the shareholders). Key risks stem from the volatility of spreads and the execution of new projects. CAP is seeking strategic partners for a new large petrochemical complex, its second, with estimated capex of USD 5 bn.

Earnings were in line with forecasts of 10 October 2019 when the forecast was last revised. It matters relatively little fundamentally as well, because the company has a steady stream of rental income on very high leverage, providing a highly-levered carry position, and then from time to time, as part of its capital policy, it \"recycles\" its capital by selling buildings. It also incurs expenses to develop new earning assets. It will be lumpy. \nIn H1 the company sold 10 investment real estate properties, 4 hotels, and one golf course. Some of the sales were likely meant to generate profits to offset losses from other sales. In the big picture, the sale of assets had been expected because of the point in the company's Medium Term Plan which is to reduce debt by 2021. That only happens with this company by selling assets. \nIn any case, because of the effort at reducing debt, and because of the Tender Offer process, for the moment it means the \"capital re-cycling\" is perhaps a bit more like \"capital un-cycling\". Because one cannot be sure how the company would plan on using the cash for the benefit of shareholders, and because there is one tender offer currently underway and one proposal for a tender offer in full negotiation mode, the earnings \"surprise\" from selling assets is effectively meaningless (and it is not that much of a surprise). The sale process of these particular assets and the selling price of at least one were known before Fortress bid, and the sale price of the other was known before Blackstone made its bid. \nThe Tender Offer Process Muddles Onward\nWhen we last wrote on the 16th of October, Blackstone had said it wanted to restart negotiations, with a goal of reaching a conclusion by 23 October. Fortress extended its Tender Offer deadline to 1 November. UNIZO came out with a revised update to its demands for Blackstone by the 21st. Blackstone extended to the 28th.

Bet on Vincent Bollore to Create Maximum Value by 17/02/22", "views": 269, "date": " 18 Oct 2019 13:38", "text": "Vivendi SA (VIV FP) just posted another strong set of 3Q results which highlight the attractiveness of UMG, the company's crown jewel. UMG saw YoY revenue growth of 20.4% to 1.8 billion EUR led by the continued success of music streaming globally. The YoY period was tough as 3Q18 had been a very strong quarter showing 38% growth vs 2017.\nImportantly, Vivendi announced that the 10% minority investment by Tencent Holdings (700 HK) in UMG would be concluded in the coming weeks. UMG will be valued at 30 billion EUR and Tencent has a call option to acquire an additional 10% on the same terms over the coming 12 months.\nThe entire market cap of Vivendi is currently 30.5 billion EUR indicating the disconnect between Vivendi's share price and its true underlying value. Surely its ownership of Canal+ and minority stakes in other publicly listed companies such as Telecom Italia Sp A (TIT IM), Mediaset SpA (MS IM), GameLoft SE (GFT FP), Havas SA (HAV FP) and Spotify Technology Sa (SPOT US) is not worth virtually nothing.\nWe also learned that Vivendi is in talks with other strategic investors to buy additional minority stakes of UMG at the same valuation. All cash received by Vivendi will be used to buy back shares. Vivendi has bought 1.3% of its shares outstanding between August and mid-October. We should expect buybacks to continue and its maximum buyback price of 25 EUR to be lifted going forward. Bollore SA (BOL FP), the investment holding of Vincent Bollore, owns 26.3% of Vivendi. Continued buybacks will increase the stake of Bollore in Vivendi which is the eventual end goal.\nWhy has Vivendi not performed better over the past 24 months given the attractiveness of UMG? Vivendi's UMG stake is the crown jewel but discussions about its valuation range have been far and wide. The entry of Tencent, and other strategic investors, finally puts a firm valuation on UMG. Additionally, Vivendi has been continuously fighting with some of its partners in investments such as Telecom Italia Sp A (TIT IM) and Mediaset SpA (MS IM). Investors are probably worried that Vivendi is a troublemaker and won't get along with the new investors coming into UMG.\nMinority investors would be wise to look through the noise and remember one date: 17/02/2022. This is the publicly announced date that Vincent Bollore will hand over his empire to his children. Historically, Bollore is often two steps ahead of investors and betting against him has rarely been a rewarding proposition. Bollore will want to end his reign on a high note and will strive to extract maximum value by early 2022.\nSOTP analysis of Vivendi easily gets a price target of 32 EUR, or 30% upside from current levels. The downside is protected by the continued share buyback program.

To the extent that the public does not sell its shares into the Open Offer, Adani Gas promoters will sell shares to get Total to a 37.4% stake in aggregate after the transactions are completed. \nThe stated goal in the press releases is joint/50-50 ownership and control of the combined Total-Adani efforts. How it gets there may not be completely straightforward.\nThe Adani Family (6 Adani-controlled companies, four individuals, two family trusts) owns 74.8% of Adani Gas after it was de-merged from Adani Enterprises (ADE IN) last year. The public owns 25.2%. \nIf the public were to tender 25.2% into the 25.2% Open Offer, Total would then own 25.2% and the existing Promoter interests would own 74.8%. The fulfilment of the SPA would get Total to 37.4% and the Promoters to 62.6%. But float would be zero. \nAccording to Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts Regulation Rules (1957), all listed companies (except for public sector companies) must maintain a minimum public shareholding of 25%. If a listed company's free-float falls below the regulatory minimum, the company has to bring the free-float back to the required level within 12 months of the date of such breach. That would require a large sell-down - at least 25% to be exact, equivalent to re-IPO-ing the company. \nWhat that means is that The Adani Family/Company Promoters and Total will actually hope that none of the Public accepts the Offer. To the extent that they do, the Promoters will have to sell down shares to keep the company listed. \nAs I write, the shares are trading 1.6% through terms at INR 152.00. The Offer Price of INR 149.63 looks low against trading levels of the past several months, but comes at a slight premium to recent trade.\nsource: tradingview.com, Quiddity\nBut to understand how this plays out, it pays to understand the public shareholder structure.

HRC traded above terms as recent as June of last year. \nThe Offer is a hybrid scheme owing to the fact HRC is PRC-incorporated with unlisted domestic shares.

In the process, Reliance Industries Limited will transfer its ownership in the Digital Services business to WOS and obtain 100% ownership of WOS.\nThis comes after the announcements of a couple of divestitures by Reliance Industries. During the year, Reliance Industries agreed to sell 49% of its Indian fuel retail business to BP and also agreed to sell 20% of the O2C division to Aramco. Reliance Industries is planning on reducing its exposure in oil and gas to reinvest that money in the Digital Services and the Retail businesses.\nThe setup of WOS is the first step as Reliance Industries intends to infuse additional capital of \u20b91,080bn into the Digital Services business through WOS. The additional capital will be used to pay off the debt at \u201cReliance Jio\u201d which is the main company in the Digital Services business segment.\nReliance Jio was immensely successful from the start and the company managed to capture market share from a fragmented telco market in India. Jio became the second-largest player in the Indian telco market within just 3 years. However, they are approaching a difficult stage in the industry cycle. The telco market is reaching maturity and there are 3 main players with another relatively smaller player operating in the Indian telco market. Over the last 3-4 years, Jio managed to drive consolidation of the fragmented market through their lower pricing and better coverage. However, Jio will now have to capture market share from other main players if they are to maintain the growth momentum. We believe it will further increase price competition and further reduce the ARPU. We also expect the likes of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to fight back harder than the smaller players. Thus, it is likely that Jio\u2019s growth may slow despite the additional investments."}, {"url": "https://www.smartkarma.com/insights/snippets-31-pttor-intro-ltf-replacement", "sector_name": "energy", "author": "Athaporn Arayasantiparb, CFA", "author_role": "Asean-focused.

While some of the credit metrics appear weak, we note that the company is in the midst of a downcycle, with the coal price at an extremely low level historically. As many smaller coal producers are loss-making, however, it is unlikely that the coal price will fall significantly lower. Indika still generated positive FCF (albeit modest) and liquidity is sound. It should thus be able to weather the downturn well.\n\nIn the near term, we continue to expect a weaker performance amid the challenging coal market. Revenue will largely be driven by coal prices. At this low price level, Kideco tends to hold back on production (no growth or even a slight decline) and only increases this when prices are strong. We foresee that profitability will be significantly reduced y-o-y, owing to the low thermal coal price in the seaborne market and rising cash costs. We expect debt to remain stable, with the company having no need to raise any debt as it is still generating FCF and has a strong cash balance.

Xerox is considering funding the offer with both cash and stock. According to CNBC, Xerox\u2019s offer to buy HP comes in at USD22 a share, consisting of 77% cash and 23% stock. HP\u2019s shares closed at USD19.39 per share on Thursday\u2019s trading, and the offer price of US$22 a share translates into a 13.5% premium to the last close price. At USD22 a share, the deal will be worth around USD33bn and Xerox will have to fund about US$22bn through debt financing to fund the deal. Our cashflow and balance sheet analysis on the combined entity reveals that it will take c. 5.5 years to pay off the debt (existing loans plus the new borrowings to fund the deal) using the free cashflows of both HP and Xerox. At USD22 a share, the deal implies a PE of about 7.7x for HP (based on TTM EPS).\nHP has been struggling with declining demand for its printing business which is the core profit generator for the company due to digitisation. At the same time, Xerox has been facing the same fate too for its copy machines and the company\u2019s revenues and profits have been declining over the past couple of years.

At the time, it continued to be a pure-play plywood business with plans of the new management to grow the branded plywood business multi-fold. Later on in 2016, the company diversified into the interior fittings business through acquisition of a company named Vector Projects (\"Vector\"). In FY18, the company also initiated some project work in the affordable housing construction space, which has since become a core business for the company.\nA close look at Uniply Industries raises more questions than answers. Its sale of plywood business to an associate company at a potentially discounted valuation raises suspicion. The cash flow movements at Uniply Industries reveal that since the new management took over in 2015, only a part of the investor capital raised has gone into real assets owned by Uniply Industries. Rest of it seems to have been diverted to either promoter\u2019s other business entities, suggesting potential conflicts of interest, or have been consumed for high working capital requirements, suggesting potential weak quality of sales. Recent announcement (as on Jul 3, 2019) around significant stake sale by the current promoter (Keshav Kantamneni) to a Gulf based investment firm raises further suspicion. Why would Keshav sell down his stake from current ~27% to ~7%, when as per management, the firm is on a high growth trajectory, has strong order book and sufficient capital to realize its full potential? Since the stake sale announcement in early July, there has been no progress towards it. The buyer (Gulf based investment firm) was supposed to deposit advance money in an escrow account but it hasn't happened yet. All the while, the merchant banker administering the deal has also resigned."}, {"url": "https://www.smartkarma.com/insights/chandra-asri-tear-sheet-lucror-analytics-0daad25c-be3c-42f7-a7c3-d0ea25baa96e", "sector_name": "materials", "author": "Lucror Analytics", "author_role": "High Yield Experts", "entity": "Chandra Asri Petrochemical", "vertical": "Credit", "title": "Chandra Asri - Tear Sheet - Lucror Analytics", "views": 265, "date": " 31 Oct 2019 16:20", "text": "We view Chandra Asri Petrochemical (CAP) as \u201cMedium Risk\u201d on the LARA scale, mainly due to the strength of its balance sheet and conservative financial policy, which together more than offset the cyclicality of the commoditised business. The company is well-positioned as Indonesia's largest petrochemicals producer in a fast-growing market. While the business is volatile and dependent on the spreads between naphtha and its products, CAP has advantages in terms of its strategic location and customer relationships, which allow it to command a slight premium over the regional benchmark. The large capex programme to increase capacity and downstream expansion is conservatively funded by both debt and equity (from rights offerings, which have been supported by the shareholders). Key risks stem from the volatility of spreads and the execution of new projects. CAP is seeking strategic partners for a new large petrochemical complex, its second, with estimated capex of USD 5 bn. It has signed an MoU with Mubadala (Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund) and OMV (an Austrian oil & gas group 24.9% owned by Mubadala) to explore the joint development of the project.\n\nOur fundamental Credit Bias on CAP is \"Negative\", due to the possibly secular decline in petrochemical margins from the massive additional capacity coming online, and the company's poor interest coverage ratios.\n\nWe view CAP\u2019s corporate governance as \u201cModerate\u201d on the LAGA scale. Our assessment takes into account: [1] its long track record of operations and listing history since 1994 (positive); [2] the shareholder structure, with a reasonably large outside shareholder (SCG) providing checks and balances; SCG has two seats on the Board of Commissioners - occupied by SCG\u2019s CEO and CFO - and two seats on the Board of Directors (neutral to positive); [3] the Board structure, with an independent president commissioner (positive); and [4] ongoing and significant related-party transactions (negative).

Its complaint about the special \"mechanism\" was public. It proposed eight days to reconcile what was an already-known position with already-known critiques and responses because of letters from Elliott and public responses by the company. After the eight days were done, they proposed another five. After those thirteen found no accord, Blackstone allowed for a further nine days whereupon UNIZO's response was \"as of the moment of this announcement we are prepared to continue discussions.\"\nThere was no announcement on the 6th. We got one late (7pm local time) in the day on the 7th. \nReference is made to the press releases of Urchin Holdings I Pte. Limited, an affiliate of funds managed and advised by Blackstone Real Estate (\u201cBlackstone\u201d), dated (i) October 15, 2019 entitled \u201cBlackstone Intends to Launch Tender Offer for Shares in UNIZO Holdings (Securities Code: 3258) at \u00a55,000 per Shar, subject to UNIZO Consent\u201d (the \u201cOctober 15 Release\u201d), announcing Blackstone\u2019s intention to acquire up to all of the outstanding common shares of UNIZO Holdings Company, Limited (Tokyo Stock Exchange; Securities Code: 3258) (\u201cUNIZO\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), subject to UNIZO consent and entry into an agreement between Blackstone and UNIZO by October 23, 2019 setting forth in further detail certain additional terms (the \u201cBlackstone Offer\u201d), (ii) October 23, 2019 entitled \u201cBlackstone Announces Extension of Deadline for UNIZO Holdings (Securities Code: 3258) to Consent and Enter Agreement Blackstone Offer\u201d (the \u201cOctober 23 Release\u201d), extending the deadline in the October 15 Release until October 28, 2019 and (iii) October 28, 2019 entitled \u201cBlackstone Announces Additional Extension of Deadline for UNIZO Holdings (Securities Code: 3258) to Consent and Enter Agreement to Blackstone Offer\u201d (the \u201cOctober 28 Release\u201d), extending the deadline in the October 23 Release until November 6, 2019.\n\nAs of 5:00 p.m., Tokyo time, on November 6, 2019 (which was the deadline specified in the October 28 Release) Blackstone has not received UNIZO\u2019s consent and entry into an agreement between Blackstone and UNIZO with respect to the Blackstone Offer. Accordingly, Blackstone is currently assessing all available options and remains prepared to engage in further discussions with UNIZO. In order to provide transparency to the UNIZO shareholders, Blackstone intends to issue a further press release as to current status by 5:00 p.m., Tokyo time, on November 18, 2019. There can be no certainty that any Tender Offer will ultimately be made and/or consummated.   Link: https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000005.000049930.html\nThis tells you after 23 days of discussing what was already on the table and had been on the table for three weeks, and had been rejected for two-plus weeks, Blackstone and UNIZO have not been able to find common ground on Blackstone buying asset-rich UNIZO at a 150% premium to undisturbed (a premium to where the board has agreed fair DCF value is) and continuing to maintain and sustain and incentivize full employment at UNIZO. \nUNIZO for its part offered a release which says, effectively (and this is my paraphrasal), \"Blackstone issued a press release saying we hadn't provided consent for them to conduct a Tender Offer. Blackstone remains prepared to engage in further discussions with UNIZO. UNIZO will continue discussions with Blackstone.\" \nI am going to persist in belabouring this deceased equine (E's pushing up daisies - it is no more). \nBlackstone says it will consider all its options. People have taken that to mean they might go hostile. I have expected the likelihood of a hostile deal by Blackstone is very low. I could be wrong, but Blackstone's entire history - everywhere in the world - is doing deals with people on a friendly, invited, basis. If you break that 35 year history of doing business in a certain way to go buy an asset with 0.00% country market share and little to no competitive moat, in one of the largest economies in the world, to amount to a total 0.25% of global AUM, \nIt seems reasonably clear that UNIZO does not want to be taken over. \nIt would be difficult for UNIZO to back down from its newly adopted \"Basic Policy\" just several weeks after having implemented it at management, employee, board, and independent committee level.\nHow does a company commit to that loudly and clearly in front of someone who has committed over US$1.3 billion and another who has committed $1.5 billion, and then back down and say \"Actually... that 'mechanism' nobody will agree to and which we insisted on in breaking our agreement with Fortress, and rejecting Blackstone, and then rejecting someone else, is, strictly speaking, not really necessary. Our bad.\"  The short answer is it does not. \nSo now we have two big foreign holders in the company for close to 25%. We have another party which has an announced 6+% position (but we do not know exactly where/how that sits). It appears the soonest one of them could \"go strong\" by calling an EGM to put their motions in front of shareholders would be January, then it would take time to get that meeting set. Then you could have a meeting, get new board members, get their feet under the desk, get a new independent committee, make sure you haven't done anything to upset 300 employees and banks and customers. Then you might find someone to launch a new tender offer under the same terms as Blackstone.\nAny really serious upside from this price is dramatic change in tax law on real estate, a new boom in Tokyo real estate, or a completely hostile bid. And none of the bidders so far, nor either of the two large public holders, are actors who could sponsor that kind of attempt."}, {"url": "https://www.smartkarma.com/insights/morning-views-asia-cifi-holdings-country-garden-holdings-co-modern-land-china-softbank-corp", "sector_name": "real_estate", "author": "Lucror Analytics", "author_role": "High Yield Experts", "entity": "Modern Land China", "vertical": "Credit", "title": "Morning Views Asia: CIFI Holdings, Country Garden Holdings Co, Modern Land China, Softbank Corp", "views": 81, "date": " 7 Nov 2019 00:00", "text": "Lucror Analytics Morning Views comprise our fundamental credit analysis, opinions and trade recommendations on high yield issuers in the region, based on key company-specific developments in the past 24 hours.

Bet on Vincent Bollore to Create Maximum Value by 17/02/22", "views": 271, "date": " 18 Oct 2019 13:38", "text": "Vivendi SA (VIV FP) just posted another strong set of 3Q results which highlight the attractiveness of UMG, the company's crown jewel. UMG saw YoY revenue growth of 20.4% to 1.8 billion EUR led by the continued success of music streaming globally. The YoY period was tough as 3Q18 had been a very strong quarter showing 38% growth vs 2017.\nImportantly, Vivendi announced that the 10% minority investment by Tencent Holdings (700 HK) in UMG would be concluded in the coming weeks. UMG will be valued at 30 billion EUR and Tencent has a call option to acquire an additional 10% on the same terms over the coming 12 months.\nThe entire market cap of Vivendi is currently 30.5 billion EUR indicating the disconnect between Vivendi's share price and its true underlying value. Surely its ownership of Canal+ and minority stakes in other publicly listed companies such as Telecom Italia Sp A (TIT IM), Mediaset SpA (MS IM), GameLoft SE (GFT FP), Havas SA (HAV FP) and Spotify Technology Sa (SPOT US) is not worth virtually nothing.\nWe also learned that Vivendi is in talks with other strategic investors to buy additional minority stakes of UMG at the same valuation. All cash received by Vivendi will be used to buy back shares. Vivendi has bought 1.3% of its shares outstanding between August and mid-October. We should expect buybacks to continue and its maximum buyback price of 25 EUR to be lifted going forward. Bollore SA (BOL FP), the investment holding of Vincent Bollore, owns 26.3% of Vivendi. Continued buybacks will increase the stake of Bollore in Vivendi which is the eventual end goal.\nWhy has Vivendi not performed better over the past 24 months given the attractiveness of UMG? Vivendi's UMG stake is the crown jewel but discussions about its valuation range have been far and wide. The entry of Tencent, and other strategic investors, finally puts a firm valuation on UMG. Additionally, Vivendi has been continuously fighting with some of its partners in investments such as Telecom Italia Sp A (TIT IM) and Mediaset SpA (MS IM). Investors are probably worried that Vivendi is a troublemaker and won't get along with the new investors coming into UMG.\nMinority investors would be wise to look through the noise and remember one date: 17/02/2022. This is the publicly announced date that Vincent Bollore will hand over his empire to his children. Historically, Bollore is often two steps ahead of investors and betting against him has rarely been a rewarding proposition. Bollore will want to end his reign on a high note and will strive to extract maximum value by early 2022.\nSOTP analysis of Vivendi easily gets a price target of 32 EUR, or 30% upside from current levels. The downside is protected by the continued share buyback program.
